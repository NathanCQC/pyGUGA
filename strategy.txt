Testing Strategy

- Shavitt graphs
    - Test that the nodal structure and edges are correct
    - Recursive walk should clarify this by generating the same number of basis states as those in CSF

    TODO: Fix the recursive walk code

- Angular Momentum Coupling
    - Test the contraction of the angular momentum coupling
    - Should equal 1 for the Overlaps
    - Can test for individual segments
    - Should equal the same as GUGA method for testing

    TODO: Need to make a loop with no open indices which will contract to a scalar

- Overlaps
    - Should always be 1
    - Will test if parameterisation is correct. (By making c_m = 1)
    - Also will further test angular momentum coupling is coupling is correct
    - Need to know and control the parametersiation this is difficult to test

    TODO: Need to make MPO (angular momentum) with MPS (state parameterisaton) and contract to a scalar

- CSF Matrix elements
    - Similar to Angular momentum coupling but now have parameterisation
    - Can compare directly to the GUGA method
    - Need to know and control the parametersiation this is difficult to test

    TODO: Need to make MPO (angular momentum) with MPS (state parameterisaton) and contract to a scalar

- Loop Driven Contraction
    - Will need to use the recursive walk technology to test this of the old school Shavitt method
    - Will it just be really slow? Testing not performance. Could be parrelised
    - Individual basis functions at one time no copy tensors etc.
    - This should allow to test the parameterisation and if it can get the GS
    - Is one density matrix element enough?
    - Value to compare the energy, need to think how this could be possible?

- Density Matrix element contraction
    - Contraction with the copy tensors
    - Need to test the contraction tensors are doing what they are supposed to
    - The TNO only needs one hamiltonian coefficent slice

- Full Contraction
    - Simulatanoutsly contract all the denisty matrix elements
    - This will test the full contraction
    - Need to have a slice for each hamiltonian coefficent. Look at Riehers method for 2Q quantum chemistry
