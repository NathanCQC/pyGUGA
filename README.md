# pyTUGA

This is a python package to calculate quantum chemistry wavefuncntions using a tensor network implementation of the unitary grouyp approach.

Key Features
- The CI vector is expressed as a product of non linear parameters contained within the tensor network
- The matrix element calculations are all done via SU(2) angular mometum coupling tensor contractions
- The tensor framework is constructed with QUIMB
