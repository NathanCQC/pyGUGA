Description: # pyTUGA
        
        This is a python package to calculate quantum chemistry wavefunctions using a tensor network implementation of the unitary group approach.
        
        Key Features
        - The CI vector is expressed as a product of non linear parameters contained within the tensor network
        - The matrix element calculations are all done via SU(2) angular mometum coupling tensor contractions
        - The tensor framework is constructed with QUIMB
